The result shows that as sample size increases, the accuracy increases, and that the biggest jump in accuracy happens when
the sample size increased from 1000 to 5000, while the improvement is less significant afterwards. The increase of accuracy
is expected as more data allows the model to perform a better fit; the less significant improvement after the training
data exceed 5000 might indicates that overfitting is happening.
